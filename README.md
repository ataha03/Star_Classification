# Star_Classification
 This dataset aims to classify stars, galaxies, and quasars based on their spectral characteristics.

Includes:
* Preparing a systematic data quality plan for the dataset
* Data cleaning
* Data standardisation and normalisation
* Choosing appropriate evaluation measures and methodologies best suited to the application and dataset
* Comparing decision trees, KNN, and 4 SVM classifiers (Linear, Sigmoid, Poly, RBF) with extensive hyperparameter testing
* Identifying most and least discriminative features in the dataset using a filter technique
* Using the most discriminating features in a wrapper feature selection technique to predict instances (e.g. sequential forward selection for all classifiers)
* In-depth comparison of classifier performance using different feature subsets
* Plotting ROC Curves for different classes and classification models

Bonus Analysis:
* Discovering correlations between features using heatmaps and ANOVA
* Investigating how PCA compares to feature selection
* Investigating how different filter algorithms perform using gini index
* Assessing feature importance using ExtraTrees
* Comparing sequential backward selection to sequential forward selection
* Assessing the performance of different  classifiers, like the Laplacian SVM kernel, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression (OVR), and Stochastic Gradient Descent.
